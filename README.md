Working to improve the work of "Hieu Nguyen and Richard Tsai" in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13184.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13184.pdf) by seperating
non-linear and linear operations with respect to the underlying physics. Goal: removal of ghost effects from paper.

See [mnist.py](mnist.py) for a test use case of this 'spatially variant' convolution.
See [Heatmaps/](Heatmaps/) for test outputs during training of the novel part of this convolutional layer.
